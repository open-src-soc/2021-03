<h2 id="K-BENINI">Seven Chips in Seven Years</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/people-a-z/person-detail.MTk0MjM0.TGlzdC8zMjc5LC0xNjUwNTg5ODIw.html">Luca Benini</a></strong> (<a href="https://ethz.ch">ETH Zürich</a>, <a href="https://www.unibo.it">Università di Bologna</a>)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pulp-platform.org">Parallel-Ultra Low Power (PULP)</a> project started in 2013 and from the beginning we wanted to keep its development open source, but we did not know how. In 2015 RISC-V came along with its open ISA and the PULP platform (<a href="https://pulp-platform.org"><code>pulp-platform.org</code></a>) emerged from this serendipitous convergence. In this talk, I will look back and, based on seven different SoCs taped out over a seven years period, I will tell the story of how our open source HW approach based on the RISC-V ISA has shaped the way we work and produced exciting results in research and technology transfer. I will then focus on the future challenges and open problems.</p>

<h2 id="P-DECKY">RISC-V and Microkernel-based Operating Systems: Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="http://www.decky.cz/">Martin Děcký</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.huawei.com/">Huawei</a>, <a href="http://www.helenos.org">HelenOS</a>)</p>
<p>Before RISC-V, the direct interactions between CPU architects and operating systems architects have been very limited and mostly unidirectional. RISC-V has the ambition to bring these communities much closer to each other.</p>
<p>Besides other goals, some of the main goals of RISC-V are to be open and free (both as in <em>free beer</em> and as in <em>free speech</em>) for designers, users and manufacturers, with strong focus on robustness, safety and security. These goals are shared by the communities around open source microkernel-based operating systems.</p>
<p>This talk summarizes the practical experiences and lessons learned from porting microkernel-basad operating systems such as HelenOS and Genode to RISC-V.</p>

<h2 id="P-ESCOUTELOUP">Preventing timing information leakages from the microarchitecture</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/mathieu-escouteloup">Mathieu Escouteloup</a></strong>, <a href="https://ronan.lashermes.0nline.fr">Ronan Lashermes</a> (<a href="https://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a>, <a href="https://www.univ-rennes1.fr">Univ.

<p>Numerous timing side-channels attacks have been proposed in recent years, showing that all shared states inside the CPU microarchitecture are potential threats. Any hardware protection against these threats requires to slightly modify the instruction set architecture (ISA), to communicate the security constraints from the software to the hardware. In this presentation, we will see how the RISC-V ISA can be modified to tackle the problem from first principles, and what the impact is on both hardware and software sides. A new open benchmark measuring timing leakages will also be introduced, making it possible to assess the vulnerability of systems and the effectiveness of implemented mechanisms.</p>

<h2 id="P-DEFERRIERE">A Compiler Approach to Cyber-Security</h2>
<p>By <strong>François de Ferrière</strong> (<a href="https://www.st.com">STMicroelectronics</a>).</p>
<p>We will present an implementation in the <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a> RISC-V compiler of software countermeasures against single fault or attack at execution time.</p>
<p>Our implementation, named <em>SecSwift</em>, proposes protections at the control-flow, data-flow and memory levels. Code is inserted to verify the correct execution of branch and call instructions, and the content of registers and memory is duplicated for specific resources. Checks are added at some points in the code to verify the correct execution of the program.</p>
<p>The insertion of countermeasures by the compiler compared to hand-written implementations has many advantages, including the activation of full compiler optimizations, a reduced development time and fine tuning of the protection level for performance and code size tradeoffs.</p>
<p>We will present our results on the qualification of these protections on applications, give figures on performance and code size impact, as well as showing annotations reported by the compiler to track protections from source code down to binary code.</p>
<p>These protections are already at production level and will be used in next products developed at STMicroelectronics to replace protections that were previously implemented by hand.</p>
<p><em>François de Ferrière is a senior compiler developer at STMicrolectronics. François has more than thirty years of experience working on a variety of compilers and on very different aspects including intermediate representations, optimizations and code generation. He has been working with the LVVM compiler for more than five years now on retargeting the <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a> compiler to STMicroelectronics proprietary processors, and since 2017 is focusing on the cyber security domain and started implementing security features in STMicroelectronics compilers.</em></p>
<h2>MaxineVM: Enabling HW/SW Co-design of managed languages on RISC-V</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.kotselidis.net">Christos Kotselidis</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk">The University of Manchester</a>, <a href="https://www.ktm-innovation.com">KTM Innovation</a>)</p>
<p>In this talk we will introduce <a href="https://github.com/beehive-lab/Maxine-VM">MaxineVM</a>: a metacircular VM for Java applications. MaxineVM is written in Java and enables the easy experimentation and HW/SW codesign with underlying architectures. Recently, RISC-V support has been added to MaxineVM besides the pre-existing compatibility with x86, ARMv7 and AArch64. The creation of a fully open source stack creates new research opportunities for more efficient integration and acceleration of managed languages. To that end, ongoing research of our group which can be extended and evaluated on RISC-V along with some research directions will be discussed</p>
<p><em>Christos Kotselidis is an Associate Professor at The University of Manchester and a Senior Architect at KTM Innovation. His interests lie in the areas of HW/SW co-design, managed programming languages, heterogeneous hardware acceleration, and embedded systems. He is currently the project lead of <a href="https://www.tornadovm.org">TornadoVM</a> and MaxineVM as well as the technical coordinator of the EU H2020 <a href="https://e2data.eu">E2Data</a> and ELEGANT projects.

<h2 id="P-LABARTA">The RISC-V vector processor in EPI</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.bsc.es/labarta-mancho-jesus">Jesús Labarta</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.bsc.es">BSC</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> project aims at developing European processor technology for High Performance Computing (HPC) and emerging application areas. Beyond leveraging ARM technology, an important objective of the project is to develop a fully owned implementation of a generic accelerator based on the RISC-V vector extension ISA. The goal of this talk is to describe the fundamental vision behind the design of such accelerator and its architectural features. I will report on the implementation status of the first version of the micro architecture. I will also present the software development vehicle (SDV) frameworks used to steer a holistic co-design approach including operating system and overall system software developments to homogenize the heterogeneous combination of different cores in the overall platform.</p>
<p><em>Prof. Jesús Labarta received his Ph.D. in Telecommunications Engineering from <a href="https://www.upc.edu">Universitat Politècnica de Barcelona (UPC)</a> in 1983, where he has been a full professor of Computer Architecture since 1990. He was Director of European Center of Parallelism at Barcelona from 1996 to the creation of BSC in 2005, where he is the Director of the Computer Sciences Dept. His research team has developed performance analysis and prediction tools and pioneering research on how to increase the intelligence embedded in these performance tools. He has also led the development of OmpSs and influenced the task based extension in the OpenMP standard. He has led the BSC cooperation with many IT companies. He is now responsible of the POP center of excellence providing performance assessments to parallel code developers throughout the EU and leads the RISC-V vector accelerator within the EPI project. He has pioneered the use of Artificial Intelligence in performance tools and will promote their use in POP, as well as the AI-centric co-designing of architectures and runtime systems.

<h2 id="P-ROKICKI">Mitigating Spectre Attacks on a RISC-V DBT-Based Processor</h2>
<p>By <strong>Simon Rokicki</strong> (<a href="https://www.univ-rennes1.fr">Univ. Rennes</a>, <a href="https://inria.fr">INRIA</a>, <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr">CNRS</a>, <a href="https://www.irisa.fr">IRISA</a>).</p>
<p>Unveiled early 2018, the <a href="https://meltdownattack.com">Spectre</a> vulnerability affects most of the modern high-performance processors. Spectre variants exploit the speculative execution mechanisms and a cache side-channel attack to leak secret data. As of today, the main countermeasures consist of turning off the speculation, which drastically reduces the processor performance. In this work, we focus on a different kind of micro-architecture: the DBT based processors, such as <a href="https://github.com/srokicki/HybridDBT">Hybrid-DBT</a>, which is capable of executing RISC-V binaries on a VLIW architecture. Instead of using complex out-of-order (OoO) mechanisms, this core combines a software Dynamic Binary Translation mechanism (DBT) and a parallel in-order architecture. The DBT is in charge of translating and optimizing the binaries before their execution. Studies show that DBT based processors can reach the performance level of OoO cores for regular enough applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that, even if those processors do not use OoO execution, they are still vulnerable to Spectre variants, because of the DBT optimizations. However, we also demonstrate that those systems can easily be patched, as the DBT is done in software and has fine-grained control over the optimization process.</p>

<h2 id="P-TEHRANI">RISC-V LW-Cryptographic Extension</h2>
<p>By <strong>Etienne Tehrani</strong>, AbdelMaklek Si Merabet, Tarik Graba &amp; Jean-Luc Danger (<a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr">Telecom-Paris</a>, <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/recherche/laboratoires/laboratoire-traitement-et-communication-de-linformation-ltci">LTCI</a>).</p>
<p>Security in pervasive connected objects and Internet of Things, is a growing concern. This increasing demand comes with increasing constraints, which led to the development of a new generation of lightweight ciphers algorithms. These algorithms have been developed to allow efficient hardware implementations and their implementation on non specialised microprocessors often lacks efficiency, especially in terms of latency and throughput. This led us to investigate for ways to accelerate the execution of such algorithms on standard processors without implementing full dedicated hardware accelerators. We have chosen to extend the RISC-V ISA by adding a small number of instructions allowing the acceleration of a representative selection of Lightweight Block Ciphers. The majority of these instructions are generic and can be used with a large range of Lightweight Block Ciphers. We present a comparison between a pristine and a modified implementation of a RISC-V core for both area overhead and execution acceleration. For some algorithms, the results show a gain of up to 100x in terms of execution speed. We are currently analysing the security of our extension regarding side channel attacks and working on implementing protection.</p>
