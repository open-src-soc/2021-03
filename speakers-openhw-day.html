<h2 id="PANEL-EUROPE">Panel – OpenHW Europe</h2>
<p>Moderated by <strong><a href="https://www.openhwgroup.org/about-us/">Rick O'Connor</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.openhwgroup.org">OpenHW Group</a>).</p>
<p>Panelists: <strong>Luca Benini</strong> (<a href="https://ee.ethz.ch">ETH Zürich</a>, <a href="https://www.unibo.it">Univ. Bologna</a>), <strong>Fabien Clermidy</strong> (<a href="https://www.cea.fr">CEA</a>), <strong>Simon Davidmann</strong> (<a href="https://www.imperas.com">Imperas Software Ltd</a>), <strong>John D. Davis</strong> (<a href="https://www.bsc.es">BSC</a>), <strong>Mike Milinkovich</strong> (<a href="https://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse Foundation</a>), <strong>Matthias Völker</strong> (<a href="https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de">Fraunhofer IIS</a>), <strong>Tim Whitfield</strong> (<a href="https://www.imaginationtech.com">Imagination Technologies Ltd</a>).</p>
<p>This panel will explore the role open-source ecosystems can play in support of national technological sovereignty goals. With the objective of the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> being the development of European know-how on the design and construction of processors for high-performance computing and thus allowing Europe technological sovereignty, what role can or should the OpenHW Group play? What are key considerations as OpenHW Europe is created to help address these objectives?</p>
